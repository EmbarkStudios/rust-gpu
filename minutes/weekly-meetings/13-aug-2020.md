 - Rust GPU project sync
    - getting libcore to compile, 1-2 months
        - could write our own pseudo-libcore as a first faster pass, with fewer features
    - 6 month guess for the project, for a single person
    - first goal: convert our own graphics shaders and use that
        - dog food the Rust GPU work
    - sub projects
        - convert existing shaders to see how ergonmic/unergonomic they would be in Rust
            - likely need Rust language changes in the longer term
                - vector intrinsics with lack of swizzles could be messy
                - casting
                - bindings 
                - groupshared
                - communication between shader stages
        - binding & user experience
            - render graph also
        - module use cases of GPU compute & graphics
            - we could open up our entire render graph in Ark and shaders, for other modules to 
    - we should play devil's advocate and argue more why we shouldn't do this
    - one of the ultimately values and goals of this projects is that we can create a community and ecosystem for it
        - one of the bigger advantages with Rust is Cargo & crates.io
        - all of this need to be usable outside of Ark, other Rust engines should use it also, and from other languages
    - Actions
        - [x] Make our repo `rust-gpu` repo that is a monorepo with our experiments and design  
        - [x] Come up with name for project. https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu/issues/2
        - [ ] List advantages and disadvantages of overall approach on in markdown docs 
        - let's continue doing weekly syncs, after the Ark Core sync
    - goal in 1-2 months. PHASE 1:
        - get the compiler prototype up, with some our own shaders
        - flesh out design documents covering the sub projects
        - prepare for either open source project and invite devs in, or decide to shutdown/push project
    - Patrick Walton mentioned he may be interested in this project
