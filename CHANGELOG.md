## [Unreleased]

### Added ‚≠ê

- Added two `spirv-builder` environment variables to customize *only* the `rustc` invocations for shader crates and their dependencies:
    - `RUSTGPU_RUSTFLAGS="..."` for shader `RUSTFLAGS="..."`
    - `RUSTGPU_CODEGEN_ARGS="..."` for shader "codegen args" (i.e. `RUSTFLAGS=-Cllvm-args="..."`)  
      (check out ["codegen args" docs](docs/src/codegen-args.md), or run with `RUSTGPU_CODEGEN_ARGS=--help` to see the full list of options)

### Changed üõ†Ô∏è

- Updated toolchain to `nightly-2022-10-29`
- Applied workspace inheritance to `Cargo.toml` files
- Moved `rustc_codegen_spirv` debugging functionality from environment variables to "codegen args" options/flags (see [the updated docs](docs/src/codegen-args.md) for more details)

### Removed üî•

- Removed the `fn`/closure `#[spirv(unroll_loops)]` attribute, as it has no users,
  is becoming non-trivial to support, and requires redesign for better ergonomics
  (e.g. `#[spirv(unroll)]` applied to individual loops, not the whole `fn`/closure)

## [0.4.0-alpha.17]

### Changed üõ†Ô∏è

- Fixed rust-gpu crates not referring to each-other by exact version
- Fixed `spirv-std` referring to an older version of `spirv-std-macros`

## [0.4.0-alpha.16]

### Added ‚≠ê

- Added check for environment variable `RUSTGPU_SKIP_TOOLCHAIN_CHECK` to prevent toolchain check

### Changed üõ†Ô∏è

- üö®BREAKINGüö® Migrated from `register_attr` to `register_tool`. [More information](docs/src/migration-to-register-tool.md).
- Updated toolchain to `nightly-2022-10-01`
- Updated `glam` to `0.22`

### Removed üî•

- Removed `glam::BVec` support (they are no longer `#[repl(simd)]` in `glam`, as Rust doesn't support SIMD vectors with `bool` elements)

## [0.4.0-alpha.15]

### Added ‚≠ê

- Build-time check for nightly toolchain version to provide user-friendly error messages.

### Changed üõ†Ô∏è

- Updated rust toolchain to `nightly-2022-08-29`.
