# Writing Shader Crates

This is section is going to walk you through writing a shader in Rust and
setting up your shader crate.

Be aware that this project is in a very early phase, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu/issues) if there's something
not working or unclear.

## Online

You can now test out and try building shaders with rust-gpu from the browser!

- [SHADERed] A shader IDE which has a lite version, which allows you to build
  and run shaders on the web.
- [Shader Playground] A playground for building and checking the output of
  shader code similar to godbolt or play.rust-lang.org.

## Local Setup
There are two main ways to setup your shader project locally.

1. Using the `spirv-builder` crate.
   The `spirv-builder` is a crate designed to automate the process of building
   and linking the `rust-gpu` to be able to compile SPIR-V shaders into your
   main Rust crate.
2. Using `.cargo/config`.
   Alternatively if you're willing to do the setup yourself you can manually set
   flags in your cargo configuration to enable you to run `cargo build` in your
   shader crate.

### Using `spirv-builder`
If you're writing a bigger application and you want to integrate SPIR-V shader
crates to display, it's recommended to use `spirv-builder` in a build script.

1. Copy the [`rust-toolchain`] file to your project. (You must use the same
   version of Rust as `rust-gpu`. Utimately, the build will fail with a nice
   error message when you don't use the exact same version)
2. Reference `spirv-builder` in your Cargo.toml:
    ```toml
    [build-dependencies]
    spirv-builder = "0.7"
    ```
    All dependent crates are published on [crates.io](https://crates.io).
3. Create a `build.rs` in your project root.

#### `build.rs`
Paste the following into `build.rs`

```rust,no_run
use spirv_builder::{MetadataPrintout, SpirvBuilder};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    SpirvBuilder::new(shader_crate, target)
        .print_metadata(MetadataPrintout::Full)
        .build()?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Substituting `shader_crate` with a relative path to your shader crate. The values available for the `target` parameter are available
[here](./platform-support.md).  For example, if building for vulkan 1.1, use
`"spirv-unknown-vulkan1.1"`.

The `SpirvBuilder` struct has numerous configuration options available, see
[documentation](https://embarkstudios.github.io/rust-gpu/api/spirv_builder/struct.SpirvBuilder.html).

#### `main.rs`
The following will directly include the shader module binary into your application.
```rust,no_run
const SHADER: &[u8] = include_bytes!(env!("<shader_crate>.spv"));
```

> **Note** If your shader name contains hyphens, the name of environment variable will be the name with hyphens changed to underscores.

Keep in mind that by default, build-dependencies are built in debug mode. This
means that the rust-gpu compiler (`rustc_codegen_spirv`) will be built in debug
mode, and will be *incredibly* slow. You can solve this by placing this bit of
configuration in your workspace `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
# Compile build-dependencies in release mode with
# the same settings as regular dependencies.
[profile.release.build-override]
opt-level = 3
codegen-units = 16
[profile.dev.build-override]
opt-level = 3
```

Keep in mind this will optimize *all* build script dependencies as release,
which may slow down full rebuilds a bit. Please read [this
issue](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu/issues/448) for more
information, there's a few important caveats to know about this.

### Using `.cargo/config`

> **Note** This method will require manually rebuilding `rust-gpu` each
  time there has been changes to the repository.

If you just want to build a shader crate, and don't need to automatically
compile the SPIR-V binary at build time, you can use `.cargo/config` to set the
necessary flags. Before you can do that however you need to do a couple of steps
first to build the compiler backend.

1. Clone the `rust-gpu` repository
2. `cargo build --release` in `rust-gpu`.

Now you should have a `librustc_codegen_spirv` dynamic library available in
`target/release`. You'll need to keep this somewhere stable that you can
reference from your shader project.

Now we need to add our `.cargo/config` file. This is a configuration file that
tells cargo how to build for SPIR-V. You need provide the target you're
compiling for (see [platform support](./platform-support.md)) and provide a path
to your built `rustc_codegen_spirv` dynamic library. We have to also provide
some additional options.

```toml
[build]
target = "spirv-unknown-spv1.3"
rustflags = [
    "-Zcodegen-backend=<path_to_librustc_codegen_spirv>",
    "-Zbinary-dep-depinfo",
    "-Csymbol-mangling-version=v0",
    "-Zcrate-attr=feature(register_tool)",
    "-Zcrate-attr=register_tool(rust_gpu)"
]

[unstable]
build-std=["core"]
build-std-features=["compiler-builtins-mem"]
```

Now we can build our crate with cargo as normal.
```bash
cargo build
```

Now you should have `<project_name>.spv` SPIR-V file in `target/debug` that you
can give to a renderer.

## Writing your first shader

Configure your shader crate as a `"dylib"` type crate, and add `spirv-std` to its dependencies. The following example also enables the `glam` vector library.

```toml
[dependencies]
spirv-std = { version = "0.7" }
```

Make sure your shader code uses the `no_std` attribute and makes the `spirv` attribute visibile in the global scope. Then, you're ready to write your first shader. Here's a very simple fragment shader called `main_fs` as an example that outputs the color red:

```rust,norun
#![no_std]

use spirv_std::spirv;
use spirv_std::glam::{vec4, Vec4};

#[spirv(fragment)]
pub fn main_fs(output: &mut Vec4) {
    *output = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
}
```
