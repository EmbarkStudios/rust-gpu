# Introduction

Welcome to the Rust-GPU dev guide! This documentation is meant for documenting
how to use and develop on Rust-GPU.

If you're looking to get started with writing your own shaders in Rust, 
check out the [_"Writing Shader Crates"_](./writing-shader-crates.md) section for
more information on how to get started.

Alternatively if you're looking to contribute to the `rust-gpu` project, have
a look at [_"Building Rust-GPU"_](./building-rust-gpu.md) section.
