    // A local access chain conversion pass identifies all function scope

    // loads and stores allowing values to propagate to their points of use where
    // possible.
    LocalAccessChainConvert,
    // Creates a local single store elimination pass.

    //
    // Currently, the presence of access chains and function calls can inhibit this

    LocalSingleStoreElim,
    // Creates an insert/extract elimination pass.
    // This pass processes each entry point function in the module, searching for
    // extracts on a sequence of inserts. It further searches the sequence for an
    // insert with indices identical to the extract. If such an insert can be
    // found before hitting a conflicting insert, the extract's result id is
    // replaced with the id of the values from the insert.
    //
    // Besides removing extracts this pass enables subsequent dead code elimination
    // passes to delete the inserts. This pass performs best after access chains are
    // converted to inserts and extracts and local loads and stores are eliminated.
    InsertExtractElim,
    // Creates a dead insert elimination pass.
    // This pass processes each entry point function in the module, searching for
    // unreferenced inserts into composite types. These are most often unused
    // stores to vector components. They are unused because they are never
    // referenced, or because there is another insert to the same component between
    // the insert and the reference. After removing the inserts, dead code
    // elimination is attempted on the inserted values.
    //
    // This pass performs best after access chains are converted to inserts and

    // pass can be advantageous on its own, it is also advantageous to execute
    // this pass after CreateInsertExtractPass() as it will remove any unused
    // inserts created by that pass.
    DeadInsertElim,
    // Create aggressive dead code elimination pass
    // This pass eliminates unused code from the module. In addition,
    // it detects and eliminates code which may have spurious uses but which do
    // not contribute to the output of the function. The most common cause of
    // such code sequences is summations in loops whose result is no longer used
    // due to dead code elimination. This optimization has additional compile
    // time cost over standard dead code elimination.
    //
    // This pass only processes entry point functions. It also only processes
    // shaders with relaxed logical addressing (see opt/instruction.h). It
    // currently will not process functions with function calls. Unreachable
    // functions are deleted.
    //
    // This pass will be made more effective by first running passes that remove
    // dead control flow and inlines function calls.
    //
    // This pass can be especially useful after running Local Access Chain
    // Conversion, which tends to cause cycles of dead code to be left after
    // Store/Load elimination passes are completed. These cycles cannot be
    // eliminated with standard dead code elimination.
    AggressiveDCE,
    // Create line propagation pass
    // This pass propagates line information based on the rules for OpLine and

    //
    // This pass is intended to maximize preservation of source line information
    // through passes which delete, move and clone instructions. Ideally it should

    PropagateLineInfo,

    // This pass eliminates redundant line instructions based on the rules for
    // OpLine and OpNoline. Its main purpose is to reduce the size of the file

    //
    // This is a bookend pass with PropagateLines which attaches line instructions
    // to every instruction to preserve line information during passes which
