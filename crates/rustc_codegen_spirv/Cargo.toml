[features]
# By default, the use-compiled-tools is enabled, as doesn't require additional
# setup steps for the user. This does however mean that you will need to disable
# default features and explicitly enable `use-installed-tools` if you are using
# this in an environment with spirv-tools in PATH, and you don't want to take
# the compile time cost
default = ["use-compiled-tools"]
# If enabled, uses spirv-tools binaries installed in PATH, instead of
# compiling and linking the spirv-tools C++ code
use-installed-tools = ["spirv-tools/use-installed-tools"]
# If enabled will compile and link the C++ code for the spirv tools, the compiled
# version is preferred if both this and `use-installed-tools` are enabled
use-compiled-tools = ["spirv-tools/use-compiled-tools"]
