# `rustc_codegen_spirv`

Compiler backend for the `SPIR-V` target architecture. This crate is not intended to be used directly. Please refer to [`spirv-builder`](https://docs.rs/spirv-builder/) for more information.

## Documentation

Because of its nature, this crate can only be built using a very specific nightly version of the Rust toolchain. As such, the `docs.rs` build of the API documentation will likely fail. Please refer to the [documentation in the `rust-gpu` github repo](https://embarkstudios.github.io/rust-gpu/api/rustc_codegen_spirv/index.html) for properly built docs.
